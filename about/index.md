Hi, I'm **Souleiman**, a student developer. I hail from Burlington, MA, near Boston, and in the fall, I will be studying computer science at Cornell University.

My long term goals as a developer and student is to create things that serve a purpose in peoples' lives. As a means to this, I like to tinker in interesting technologies such as computer vision while developing my algorithmic and software development skills.

I am most experienced with Java, C++, and Objective C. I have some projects up on my [github](https://github.com/soule).

As hobbies, I enjoy playing soccer and tennis, and traveling.
